# Blocking
I'm not satisfied with the way Shields have been implemented in Terraria. Their main use is extra Defense and added resistance to certain Debuffs. The Brand of The Inferno was an excellent idea, but its mechanic is solely attached to that weapon alone.

The goal of this mod is to expand upon the usage of Shields. To give them greater purpose than just for more armor and a parry ability that can only be used with a specific weapon.

As of now, this mod adds 2 features: Blocking and Parrying.

## Blocking

Hold the Keybind to Block. During this action, the Player gains a boost in Endurance (+50%), but items cannot be used, and they are slowed down.

If a Shield is equipped while Blocking, the Player is granted Shield Benefits. For now, these encompass additional Endurance (+35%). When the Player is struck during a Shield Block, a certain amount of Mana is consumed. This scales with their Max Mana. Once it is too low to be consumed, Shield Benefits are forfeit.

## Parrying

When blocking, there is a half-second time frame to initiate a Parry. Come in contact with damage caused by enemies or projectiles, and all but 1 point of damage will be nullified. Additionally, the attacker will be damaged. This damage scales with their Max HP, so Parrying is quite useful if in a conflict with enemies stronger than you.
