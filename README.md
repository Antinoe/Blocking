# Blocking
I'm not satisfied with the way Shields have been implemented in Terraria. Their main use is extra Defense and added resistance to certain Debuffs. The Brand of The Inferno was an excellent idea, but its mechanic is solely attached to that weapon alone.

The goal of this mod is to expand upon the usage of Shields. To give them greater purpose than just for more armor and a parry ability that can only be used with a specific weapon.

As of now, this mod adds 2 features: Blocking and Parrying.

## Blocking
Hold the Hotkey to Block. During this action, the player gains a boost in Defense, but items cannot be used, and they are slowed down.

## Parrying
When blocking, there is a half-second time frame to initiate a Parry. Come in contact with damage caused by enemies or projectiles, and all but 1 point of damage will be nullified. Additionally, the attacker will be damaged. This damage scales with their Max HP, so Parrying is quite useful if in a conflict with enemies stronger than your current tier.
