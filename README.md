I'm not satisfied with the way Shields have been implemented in Terraria. Their main use is extra Defense and added resistance to certain Debuffs. Items like the Brand of The Inferno were a step in the right direction, but their mechanics are solely attached to those weapons alone.

So I made this. The main purpose is to not only provide a little more variety to Combat, but to also expand upon the usage of Shields.

**Below are the features (EVERYTHING IS CONFIGURABLE):**

__Guarding__
-Hold the Keybind to Guard. During this action, the Player gains a boost in Endurance, but items cannot be used, and they are slowed down.
-Wearing Boots reduces the Movement Penalty of Guarding.
-Wearing Gloves slightly increases the Endurance boost while Guarding.
-Press the respective Keybind while Guarding to perform a Guard Bash. Doing so will knock enemies back and deal Thorns damage to them.
-NPCs can also have a chance of Guarding if added to the Whitelist provided in the Config.

__Parrying__
-Press the respective Keybind to Parry. Upon doing so, there is a small time frame to successfully avoid an attack.
-Damage received while Parrying will completely nullify it.
-Additionally, the Player is granted the Striking Moment buff for a brief time, allowing their next Melee strike to deal +400% damage.
-NPCs can also have a chance of Parrying if added to the Whitelist provided in the Config.

__Shield Rework__
-For every 1 Defense a shield grants, the Player is bestowed extra Max Life.
-Potent Guarding can be toggled. When it is active, damage is absorbed at the cost of consuming Mana. This scales with the Player's Defense, so increasing it proves beneficial.
-NPCs can also have a chance of Shield Guarding if added to the Whitelist provided in the Config.
