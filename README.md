# Blocking

I'm not satisfied with the way Shields have been implemented in Terraria. Their main use is extra Defense and added resistance to certain Debuffs. Items like the Brand of The Inferno were a step in the right direction, but their mechanics are solely attached to those weapons alone.

So I made this. The main purpose is to not only provide a little more variety to Combat, but to also expand upon the usage of Shields.


Below are the features (EVERYTHING IS CONFIGURABLE):

## __Guarding__

-Hold the Keybind to Guard. During this action, the Player gains a boost in Endurance, but items cannot be used, and they are slowed down.
-Wearing Boots reduces the Movement Penalty of Guarding.
-Wearing Gloves slightly increases the Endurance boost while Guarding.
-Press the respective Keybind while Guarding to perform a Guard Bash. (Experimental feature. Unfinished as of now.)

## __Parrying__

-When Guarding, there is a small time frame to initiate a Parry.
-Performing a Parry on NPCs and Projectiles will nullify damage.
-Additionally, the Player is granted the Striking Moment buff for a brief time, allowing their next Melee strike to deal +400% damage.

## __Shield Rework__
-For every 1 Defense a shield grants, the Player is bestowed extra Max Life.
-If a Shield is equipped while Guarding, the Player is granted Shield Benefits. During this action, damage received will be completely nullified at the cost of Mana Consumption.
-This scales with the Player's Defense, so increasing it proves beneficial. Once it is too low to be consumed, or the attack is higher than what the Player's current Mana can handle, then damage is no longer nullified.
